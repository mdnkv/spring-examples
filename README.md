This repository contains a Spring Boot project with code, that is used as example for posts and videos in my blog and on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mdnkv).

So, this project is an e-commerce application; much smaller in scope than Shopify and even WooCommerce, but still it aims to cover essential features of any modern e-commerce app. And I believe that this type of app has a lot of interesting things that you could implement and learn a lot of useful stuff.
